       <h1>About Me</h1>
       <h3>My name is Salma Ahmed - I'm a multimedia design student with a big heart for digital design, photography and videography.</h3>
       <p>My personal aim is to design an inspirational piece that defines my clients value of proposition.
         I value quality and personal design. I communicate through my work and especially through photography and videography.
         I always have my camera with me, whether it be with my phone or my beloved Canon 700D.
         I recently got into digital design and I'm becoming better by the day.
         On my portfolio page you can see some of the work I've been working on. </p>
         <ul>
           <li><a href="portfolio.html">Explore portifolio here</a></li>
         </ul>

         <p>I am skilled in most of the adobe package programs and some i'm still learning.
           And now I can also say I'm quite skilled in HTML5 and CSS, and for that I use Atom, whom I'm now also skilled in.
           I work white other programs outside of school, such as Blender 3D printing and Canva.</p>
